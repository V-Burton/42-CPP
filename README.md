# CPP Piscine Project Overview

## Introduction
Welcome to the **CPP Piscine Project**, a comprehensive program designed to immerse you in the world of C++ programming. This project serves as a foundational step in learning the C++ (CPP) language, focusing specifically on the CPP98 standard.

## Resource Guidelines
While there are numerous resources available online for learning C++, it is crucial to remember that this project is limited to the **CPP98 standard**. Here are some recommended resources that should become you bible:

- [Cplusplus.com Reference](https://cplusplus.com/reference/)
- [CPP Reference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/)

Before using any function or feature, verify its availability in the CPP98 standard.

## Compilation Flag
To ensure your code adheres to the CPP98 standard, use the compilation flag `-std=C++98`. This flag will restrict your code to CPP98 compatible features and functions.

## Recommended Reading
One highly recommended resource is the book **'Learning C'**. Released during the era when CPP98 was the prevalent standard, this book guarantees accurate and relevant information.

## Utilizing ChatGPT
ChatGPT can be an invaluable asset during your learning journey. However, it's essential to use it wisely:
- **Do Not** rely on ChatGPT for direct answers.
- **Do Use** ChatGPT as a personal tutor: Ask for brief explanations on new concepts and request exercises that reinforce your understanding.

Embracing ChatGPT as an interactive learning tool can significantly enhance your grasp of the C++ language.

# Conclusion
Embarking on the CPP Piscine Project is an exciting journey into the depths of C++ programming. By utilizing the right resources and approaches, you'll gain a solid foundation in the CPP98 standard, setting you up for future success in the world of C++.
